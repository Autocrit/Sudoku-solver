Sudoku solver in HTML, CSS and Javascript

Code by Thorsten Altenkirch/Computerphile (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM), translated from Python.

Also, Conceptual Programming with Python by Isaac Triguero and Thorsten Altenkirch, p.89 (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nUO0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false).
